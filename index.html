    <h1>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h1>

    <p>
        My first week was exactly what I expected it to be, a lot of information at once. A lot of good resources have been provided through slack to assist in understanding the topics at hand better. I've done remote learning and taken meetings through zoom in the past so I kinda knew what to expect.

    </h1>

    <p>
        I took the Intro to Web Development program in the fall, we focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, I’m excited to learn more languages and create fun things with them.

<p>
    Something about me that could only be learned by reading this blog is that I love to travel. I met my husband at a bus stop in Vienna, Austria, got engaged in Fiji and married in Las Vegas!

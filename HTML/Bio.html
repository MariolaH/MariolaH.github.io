                            Hi everyone! My name is Mariola, I live in Lexington with my husband Richie. Originally, I
                            am from Poland, I grew up in Canada and have been living in Lexington for almost 7 years.
                            Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, hiking and traveling. Currently, I work in the
                            hospitality industry, prior to that I worked as a real estate agent for a few years.

                            I was introduced to this bootcamp through a friend that took it last year, he really liked
                            it and spoke very highly of it so I decided to look into it for myself. Prior to pursing the
                            bootcamp I took the Intro to Web Development bootcamp and really enjoyed it and decided to
                            pursue the Web Developer bootcamp.
                        </p>

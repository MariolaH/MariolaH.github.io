### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
```
My first week was exactly what I expected it to be, a lot of information at once. A lot of good resources have been provided through slack to assist in understanding the topics at hand better. I've done remote learning and taken meetings through zoom in the past so I kinda knew what to expect.

```
What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I took the Intro to Web Development program in the fall, we focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, I’m excited to learn more languages and create fun things with them.
``` 
```
What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

Something about me that could only be learned by reading this blog is that I love to travel.  I met my husband at a bus stop in Vienna, Austria, got engaged in Fiji and married in Las Vegas!

What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

Each language plays a different role in user experience. Html renders the foundation, css styles that foundation and JavaScript adds functionality. The 3 languages working together as opposed to individually create a superior user experience.

```
What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

I think pseudocode is a great way to build the foundation for your code. It ensures that all the steps are layed out and nothing is missed before any code is written. 
```
```
What was helpful during Onboarding that made working remotely easier?

I think what was really helpful during onboarding remotely was the availability of the instructors, help from fellow boot campers when I had questions, as well, all the resources that were provided. 
```
```
What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

What hinder my progress during onboarding was getting stuck on a topic and spending too much time trying to figure out the answer on my own. Looking back I should have ask for help much sooner than I did.

```
How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

I overcame challenges during onboarding by asking more questions, asking for help and reviewing the material several times. 
```
```
What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

I don’t believe anything really held me back this week, whenever I had a question or didn’t understand something I did some research on the topic or asked for help.

```
```
What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

One thing I would really like to understand better is JavaScript functions and loops. For some reason I am having a hard time understanding how to write a function and what some of the syntax means and how it all works together. 
```
```


Person learning compared to remote there is always someone there to help you with an issue, whether it’s an instructor or classmate. We do have a help channel on slack and everyone is always available, but I believe in person is a different experience. 
```
```
What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

This week we learned about axios and APIs, and followed our learning with two assignments. Working on both assignments helped me better understand the topics at hand.
```
```
What does it mean to develop good code?

What I think it means to develop good code is it starts with good pseudocode then it develops into clean and concise code.
```
```
What does it mean to be a good developer?


I think what it means to be a good developer is you have to be a good problem solver. A lot of the time it seems like you run into bugs or code that doesn’t work and you have to figure out where the bug is and how to resolve the issue. 
```
```
What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

One thing that programmers would hate is looking at other programmers code not being able to decipher what is what. This is why adding comments to code helps you and other programmers navigate through code better.

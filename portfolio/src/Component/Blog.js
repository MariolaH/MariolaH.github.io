                      My first week was exactly what I expected it to be, a lot
                      of information at once. A lot of good resources have been
                      provided through slack to assist in understanding the
                      topics at hand better. I've done remote learning and taken
                      meetings through zoom in the past so I kinda knew what to

                      and JavaScript adds functionality. The 3 languages working
                      together as opposed to individually create a superior user

                      I think initially they are harder to use because you are
                      learning something new. Once you understand the
                      fundamentals and how to implement the frameworks and libr
                      /aries it will be easier to use.{" "}

                      A framework that I am interested in learning about is

                      that I have conducted it seems to be the most popular libr

                      A JavaScript tool that I would like to learn more about
                      and incorporate into my day to day coding is ESLint.
                      ESLint is a debugging tool that analyzes your code, it
                      flags programming errors, suspicious constructs, bugs and
                      stylistic errors. It will be very handy while I am
                      creating my final project.
